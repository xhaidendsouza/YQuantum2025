Notes:
1. States that wildfires tend to stop spreading as they approach homes, particularly homes of high value.
2. Fire managers usually try to minimize the sum of the cost of supression and the expected damages.
3. 


Model:
We have a grid of locations of size n x n, where each box x_ij in the grid is assigned a category (see below). We have a Hamiltonian H_r for each resource r.
H_r = w_11 x_11 + w_12 x_12 + w_13 x_13 + ... + w_ij x_ij

One variable per location (grid element):
* 0 - do NOT send the resource r there
* 1 - send resource r there

weights are calculated from a combination of factors. w = C_1 Deaths + C_2 Monies, where C_1 and C_2 are some constants. The category of land effects this.
It costs more money to stop a deep forest fire. Places with houses would have a high weight of deaths. The second thing that effects this is risk of fire to spread.
Adjacent fire and directional fire.

Weights are calculated automatically, and each cell doesn't have a unique weight, rather each *type* of cell (H, D, E; fire risk, population) has its own type of weight calculated via manually-set multipliers.

Fire chief should be able to select a strategy, and that strategy tunes the weights accordingly. Stopping it early could increase weights of fighting it early in deep forest
before it spreads


Categories:
1. H - Homes (any number of people)
2. D - Deep forest
3. E - Edge forest

Properties per cell (stored as a dictionary per cell):
1. Fire risk (from 0 being no chance of fire to 1 being actively on fire, continuous)
2. Population (number of people >= 0, discrete)

Resources:
1. Air support 
2. Ground crews
3. Controlled burns crews / fire lines

We will have 


Limitations & Future Things to Do:
* More fine-grain detail
* Intensity of fires
* Real-time update (fire over time)
* Fire risk
* More categories & Properties
* Scale of distance (how big is each block?)
