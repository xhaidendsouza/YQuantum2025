Notes:
1. States that wildfires tend to stop spreading as they approach homes, particularly homes of high value.
2. Fire managers usually try to minimize the sum of the cost of supression and the expected damages.
3. 


Model:
We have a grid of locations, where each box x_n in the grid is assigned a category such as deep forest, forest edge, housing
H_resource1 = w_1 x_1 + w_2 x_2 + w_3 x_3 + ... + w_n x_n
weights are calculated from a combination of factors. w = C_1 Deaths + C_2 Monies, where C_1 and C_2 are some constants. The category of land effects this.
It costs more money to stop a deep forest fire. Places with houses would have a high weight of deaths. The second thing that effects this is risk of fire to spread.
Adjacent fire and directional fire.



Fire chief should be able to select a strategy, and that strategy tunes the weights accordingly. Stopping it early could increase weights of fighting it early in deep forest
before it spreads

Categories:
1. H - Housing
2. D - Deep forest
3. E - Edge forest

Properties:
1. On fire
2. High risk
3. Low risk
4. No risk

Resources:
1. Air support
2. Ground crews
3. Controlled burns crews / fire lines


Limitations & Future Things to Do:
* More fine-grain detail
* Intensity of fires
* Real-time update (fire over time)
* Fire risk
* More categories & Properties
