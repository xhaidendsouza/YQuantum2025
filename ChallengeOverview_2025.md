# Quantum Computing for Wildfire Response (2025)

Wildfires pose an increasingly severe global threat, with recent major fires such as the 2024  
Davis Fire near Reno, as well as devastating events in Los Angeles and Maui, highlighting critical  
gaps in current wildfire management strategies. Effective disaster response demands rapid and  
optimal allocation of essential resources—including firefighting personnel, equipment, water  
supplies, evacuation planning, and logistical coordination—to protect communities, minimize  
destruction, and ultimately save lives. Quantum computing offers a groundbreaking capability  
to address these complex, real-time resource allocation and monitoring challenges by efficiently  
navigating vast and dynamic decision spaces.

## Challenge Overview:

Teams will leverage Quantum Annealing and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm  
(QAOA) to address real-world wildfire management issues, specifically focusing on resource  
allocation, evacuation logistics, or real-time monitoring. Problems will be formulated within the  
Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) framework, a computational model  
well-suited for quantum solutions.

## Team Responsibilities:

- Clearly define a focused wildfire response challenge involving resource allocation,  
  evacuation logistics, or monitoring.  
- Formulate the challenge as a QUBO problem.  
- Solve the formulated QUBO problem using Quantum Annealing or QAOA methodologies.  
- (Optional) Extend the solution to additional complexities or validate it using actual  
  quantum computing hardware.

## Deliverables:

1. Concise presentation (slides or short video) outlining the problem, results, and potential  
   real-world implications.  
2. Technical Writeup detailing QUBO formulation, solution method, and insights.  
3. Annotated iPython Notebooks with code, simulation logs, and results (plots, metrics).

## Judging Criteria:

- **30%** | Technical Implementation & Use of Quantum Tools  
- **30%** | Correctness & Practicality  
- **20%** | Creativity & Innovation  
- **10%** | Presentation Quality  
- **10%** | Writeup and Notebook  

## Starter Resources:

- Quantum Annealing: A Primer (arxiv.org)  
- QUBO Formulation Examples (arxiv.org)  
- Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA) Overview (arxiv.org)  
- Quantum Algorithms for Optimization Problems (IEEE)  

By leveraging quantum computing’s ability to tackle complex optimization landscapes, we can  
develop innovative, real-time solutions for wildfire response—ultimately helping communities  
stay safer and more resilient.
