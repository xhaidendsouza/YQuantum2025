    "## 1. Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Wildfires pose an increasingly severe global threat, as highlighted by recent major fires such as the 2024 Davis Fire near Reno and devastating events in Los Angeles and Maui. These incidents underscore critical gaps in current wildfire management strategies. Effective disaster response requires rapid and optimal allocation of limited resources—including firefighters, equipment, water supplies, and evacuation logistics—to protect communities, minimize destruction, and ultimately save lives. Additionally, real-time monitoring of wildfire progression is challenging, as fires can spread unpredictably and rapidly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum computing offers groundbreaking capabilities to address these complex resource allocation and wildfire monitoring challenges. By efficiently navigating vast and dynamic decision spaces, quantum computing techniques—specifically Quantum Annealing and the Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA)—provide powerful tools for optimizing emergency response.\n",
    "\n",
    "Two specific classes of problems naturally arise in wildfire management scenarios:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Resource Allocation**, which can be framed as a Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) problem. This formulation helps optimize how limited resources (personnel, equipment, water supplies, etc.) are distributed to ensure they are deployed where most critically needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Wildfire Monitoring**, which can be modeled as a Maximum Independent Set (MIS) problem. Representing critical monitoring points as nodes in a graph, the MIS approach identifies optimal, non-overlapping locations for effective surveillance.\n",
    "\n",
    "This notebook introduces you to quantum computing tools and techniques suited to these problems. Much of your work in this hackathon will involve developing and extending the provided examples, identifying meaningful real-world problems, and applying quantum solutions to them. The examples included here serve as a starting point. Helpful resources are provided at the end of the notebook to guide you as you develop your solutions."

    "Quadratic Unconstrained Binary Optimization (QUBO) is a powerful framework used to express complex optimization problems in a compact, mathematical form. In a QUBO formulation, the goal is to minimize a quadratic function of binary variables. This framework is especially useful for problems like resource allocation, where decisions (e.g., whether or not to allocate a resource) can be naturally modeled as binary variables (0 for no allocation, 1 for allocation).\n",

    "   - The same logic applies to other off-diagonal pairs like `('D', 'B')`, `('C', 'A')`, etc.\n",

    "Putting it all together, the matrix shows how each pair of variables contributes to the objective function. Negative diagonal entries encourage selecting sensors, while positive off-diagonal entries penalize placing sensors in locations that are too close to each other. The solver’s job is to find binary values for each variable (`A`, `B`, `C`, `D`) that minimize the total energy of this QUBO—ultimately striking a balance between choosing as many sensors as possible and avoiding adjacent placements. Note we haven't actaully solved this QUBO problem, we just reframed our toy problem in a QUBO framework. We will next show how to use Quantum Annealing and QAOA to solve the QUBO problem. "

    "## 6. Recap and Challenge Statement\n",
    "Phew, we've given you a lot of tools and things to learn about! Let's quickly recap what we've done so far, and then proceed with the challenge statement. There are two types of problems we've considered so far, resource allocation problems (which can be easily formulated as QUBO problems), and wildfire monitoring problems (which can be formulated as MIS problems, and then converted to QUBO). Here's what we want you to do:\n",
    "1. Understand the physics, math, and intuition behind QUBO, Quantum Annealing, and QAOA\n",
    "2. Create a resource allocation problem statement that a Fire Chief would face when dealing with an active wildfire, or a wildfire monitoring problem formulated as a MIS statement. Then, rewrite your problem using the QUBO formalism (note: we haven't gone through how to write an MIS problem as a QUBO statement, but there are useful resources in the links at the bottom that will help with this!)\n",
    "3. By either using a quantum annealing simulator, or the mapping to Rydberg atoms and QAOA solver (or both!), solve the QUBO problem that you formulated and interpret the results.\n",
    "4. Optional: Come up with a new problem that you think firefighters face when addressing wildfires and justify its importance. Then use the tools we've discussed to solve it\n",
    "5. Optional: Use the Qbraid platform to run your problem on an actual quantum computer! \n",
    "\n",
    "This challenge has a lot of components. We don't expect you to complete each and every part (for example, you can choose to focus on quantum annealers rather than QAOA to solve your QUBO problems). We want to see you attempt and solve as many parts as you can, with emphasis placed on being creative when coming up with new problems and applying the tools you've learned. \n",
    "\n",
    "**Deliverables:**\n",
    "1. ***Presentation*** of your work\n",
    "2. ***Writeup*** of your solution\n",
    "3. ***Annotated iPython notebook*** containing any simulations or work you want considered. "
